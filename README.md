The folder includes all data of 5 categories BILL, CAPTION, (Visa) CARD, NAMECARD, and PRODUCT with their ground truths of text lines; and the detected results of 6 selected state-of-the-art methods: CRAFT, CTPN, EAST, FOTS, PixelLink, and PSENet. 

The folder is organized as:
```
 -hblab-textdetection --- images
              |---------- groundtruth
              |---------- exp-results ( all .txt and images)
                              |--------- CRAFT
                              |--------- CTPN
                              |--------- EAST
                              |--------- FOTS
                              |--------- PixelLink
                              |--------- PSENet
